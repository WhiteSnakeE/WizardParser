Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request

### Instruction: Create pom.xml and add these dependencies:spring-boot-starter-web, spring-boot-starter-actuator, spring-boot-starter-test, junit-jupiter, spring-boot-starter-data-jpa, springdoc-openapi-starter-webmvc-ui.
Generate Book class with id, name, yearOfPublushing, language fields. Create BookDTO with the same fields and use @Entity annotation.
Generate BookService with methods: method register(Book book) that need to save book to database and method getBookByid(Long bookId) to return book with this id;
Generate BookRepository interface with the same methods as BookService. BookService must use BookRepository in methods.
Generate BookController class with two methods:
registerBook(Book book) with '/register' endpoint and getBookByid(Long bookId) with '/get' endpoint, use BookService in these methods for saving book and getting book, 
use io.swagger for BookController class. Create BookConverter class that convert Book to BookDTO and via verse. Use Converter in BookService in method getBookByid to return Book.
Create test for BookService methods, use Mockito for tests.

### Response:Here is the pom.xml file with the required dependencies:

Here is the Book class with the required fields:

```java
import javax.persistence.*;

@Entity
public class Book {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    private String name;

    private int yearOfPublushing;

    private String language;

    public Long getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public void setId(Long id) {
        this.id = id;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public int getYearOfPublushing() {
        return yearOfPublushing;
    }

    public void setYearOfPublushing(int yearOfPublushing) {
        this.yearOfPublushing = yearOfPublushing;
    }

    public String getLanguage() {
        return language;
    }

    public void setLanguage(String language) {
        this.language = language;
    }
}
```
